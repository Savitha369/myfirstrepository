                        A masterpiece of the Dutch Golden Age, Vermeer's "Girl with a Pearl Earring" has transfixed viewers with her wistful<br>
                        gaze ever since the painting resurfaced in the late 19th century. Little, however, is known about the young woman<br>
                        who modeled for the portrait. It has been suggested that the girl was Vermeer's daughter or mistress.<br>
                        While this may be the case, the image wasn't intended to represent an actual person. The turban worn<br>
                        by the sitter indicates that the piece was intended as a "tronie," an idealized image cloaked in exotic clothing.<br>

                        Surrealist Salvador Dali subverts reality with this mesmerizing image of deflated timepieces <br>
                        scattered over a desert landscape. The composition defies logic, evoking a dream-like state. <br>
                        Dali employed the "paranoiac-critical method" in his artistic process, self-inducing a delusional state.<br>

                        Vincent van Gogh has painted countless well-known pieces; however, his painting Starry Night<br>
                        is widely considered to be his magnum opus. Painted in 1889, the piece was done from memory and <br>
                        whimsically depicts the view from his room at the sanitarium he resided in at the time.<br>
