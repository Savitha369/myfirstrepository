                Darjeeling tea is the only tea in the world to get protection under the Geographical Indication (GI) trademark.<br>
                It is said that these teas are the highest elevation produced teas world over and<br>
                it is the altitude that creates an ideal environment for the tea plant.<br>
                The result is that the teas grown here are imparted with<br> a unique flavour and special aroma.<br>
                Since Darjeeling tea is grown exclusively in select tea plantations at the foothills of the Himalayas spread across<br>
                the district of Darjeeling, only approximately 11,000 tons of tea is produced each year from the official Darjeeling region.<br>
                This contributes to around 1% of the total tea production of India.

                Yoga cultivates health and wellbeing (physical, emotional, mental and social) through the regular practice of a range<br>
                of many different techniques, including postures and movement, breath awareness and breathing exercises, relaxation and<br>
                concentration, self-inquiry and meditation.<br>
                Yoga is an approach to life that values appropriate effort, based on balance and harmony,<br>
                within each person and with each other.<br>
                In Yoga, the body, breath and mind are seen as a union of these multi-dimensional aspects of each and every human being.<br>
                The system and various techniques of Yoga cultivate the experience of that union, leading to greater integration of being,<br>
                internal peacefulness, and clarity of the mind.<br>
                It is a system that is designed to cultivate health and happiness, and a greater sense of self-awareness and higher consciousness.<br>
